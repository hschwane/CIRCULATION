# CIRCULATION
Cuda InteRactive Climate simULATION.

This was an experiment, to see how well climate simulation can be performed and visualized interactively on the GPU.
The code is highly experiemntal and many features might not work as expected. See [my website](https://hschwane.github.io/projects/CIRCULATION) for more information on the project. 

There is also a [pdf](https://hschwane.github.io/assets/pdf/schwanekamp2020interactiveMeteorology.pdf) which explains the experiments results and learned lessons. while the pdf might be formatted like a research paper it was not peer reviewed and published in the traditional way. It is merly a project documentation and should be treated as such.

## dependencies
Use the mpUtils verison taged with `version_for_CIRCULATION` to compile. Most recent version will not work.
